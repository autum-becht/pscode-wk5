c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

create a dictionary or list to store the numbers.
perform a series of aggregate functions to perform mean, min and max for the list and 
finish with a print function defining each result.
